# This file is used to specify the versions of Kafka which will be built
# and supported by the Cluster Operator. It affects both compile time and runtime:
#   * The docker images built (see docker-images/build.sh)
#   * The KAFKA_IMAGE_MAP configuring the CO in the helm-charts (see helm-charts/kafka-version-tpl.sh)
#   * The io.strimzi.operator.cluster.model.KafkaVersion's loaded at runtime
#   * Documentation snippets generated by `make docu_versions`
# The idea is that this is the single place you need to update when changing the supported Kafka versions

# Format of this file:
# blank lines are ignored
# lines starting with # are comments
# non-comment lines are whitespace separated and have the format
#   <version>  <default>  <proto>   <msg>   <sha512>
# where:
#   <version> is the kafka version number
#   <default> is default if this is the default Kafka version, or empty otherwise
#   <proto> is the Kafka protocol version used by this Kafka version
#   <msg> is the Kafka message version used by this Kafka version
#   <sha512> is the SHA512 checksum

# NOTICE: If you change the default here, you should also change it in documentation/book/common/attributes.adoc
